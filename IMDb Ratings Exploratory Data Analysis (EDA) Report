Average Rating Hierarchy
------------------------
Top Tier (7.4-7.8):

- Crime: 7.8 - Highest performing genre, likely due to sophisticated storytelling
- Animation: 7.5 - Strong quality control due to high production investment
- Biography: 7.5 - Selective production focusing on compelling real stories
- Adventure: 7.4 - Broad appeal with quality production values
- Thriller: 7.4 - Consistent audience engagement

Mid Tier (6.8-7.2):

- Action: 7.2 - Popular but variable quality
- Drama: 7.0 - High volume genre with mixed results
- Comedy: 6.8 - Subjective humor affecting ratings
- Fantasy: 6.8 - Mixed reception for genre conventions

 Lower Tier:

- Horror: 6.3 - Lowest average, possibly due to niche appeal and high volume of lower-budget productions

Strategic Insights
------------------
- Quality vs. Volume: Higher-rated genres tend to have more selective production

* 3. Rating Correlation Analysis *
**********************************

IMDb vs MetaScore Relationship
Correlation Strength: 0.70 (Strong positive correlation)

- Indicates substantial agreement between professional critics and general audiences
- 70% of rating variance is shared between the two systems
- Strong enough to suggest reliability but different enough to provide unique perspectives

Outlier Analysis
----------------
- Critical Disagreements (â‰¥1.0 difference):

Red-highlighted outliers show significant rating disparities.These represent movies where critics and audiences
fundamentally disagree.

Common patterns for outliers:
- Critic favorites/Audience disappointments: High MetaScore, lower IMDb
- Crowd pleasers/Critical failures: High IMDb, lower MetaScore

Polarizing content: Generates strong but divided opinions

Implications
------------
Most movies achieve reasonable consensus between critics and audiences. Outliers represent either misaligned
expectations or genuinely divisive content. The 0.70 correlation suggests both rating systems capture movie quality
effectively.

*******************************

Key Findings from Duration Analysis
------------------------------------

Positive Duration-Rating Correlation:

- Clear upward trend: longer movies tend to receive higher ratings
- Confidence interval shows statistical significance of this relationship

Duration Categories Performance:

- Epic films show highest rating distributions
- Long films demonstrate strong performance consistency
- Medium-length films show most variability
- Short films have wider rating distribution with lower averages

Distribution Insights (Violin Plots)
------------------------------------
- Epic: Concentrated in higher rating ranges (7-9)
- Long: Consistent quality with tight distribution
- Medium: Broadest distribution, indicating variable quality
- Short: Bimodal distribution suggesting two distinct quality tiers

Strategic Implications
----------------------
Longer runtimes correlate with higher perceived quality. May indicate more complex storytelling, character development,
or production investment. Epic films likely represent major studio investments with higher quality control.
